# Billy Bubs Table Craps (App 2): Builder Checklist

**Spec:** `two-games-spec.md` **rev 15a** + `table-strategies-appendix.md` (rev 15a, DECIDED) + `etiquette-guide.md`. **Date:** Oct 12, 2026. **Rev 15a adds** §3a Chip rail, §16 Point-made celebration, §17 Rule 0 real dice, §18 Etiquette, RT-24 to RT-32, and removes the T-24 skill simulation (Bill, 10:31 AM). **Rev 15d adds** §19 Craps Lingo (`craps-lingo.md`, `lingo.json`), RT-33 to RT-37 and flag F10. **Rev 16 (Oct 13) adds** the round-5 batch: §20 Session history (SH-01–SH-12), §21 Your Dice (YD-01–YD-14), §22 Table rule settings and limit tiers (RS-01–RS-12; tiers PROPOSED), §23 Roll speed (FR-01–FR-10), §24 Quick bets (QB-01–QB-14), §25 Payout drills (PD-01–PD-12), RT-38 to RT-44 and flags F11–F16. Rev 16 rows were checked against branch `cursor/table-craps-6ff7` @ `34f012d` where it says so.
**Bar:** App Store quality, the same bar as Bubble Craps (QA runs 3–15). Every line is testable. **Spec references** use the spec's own section IDs (S1–S7, A2.x, T-xx); **App** = the appendix.
**Reuse source:** repo `wjenson27-cpu/bb-bc-yrkv`, **main @ `51c229b`** ("Fix seven-out contrast, Billy overlap, and count plurals", #16). I read it from a read-only clone at `/tmp/bbbc51`. Every module and function name below comes from that commit. Line numbers are from that commit too.
**Practice / play money only.** No real-money, prize or cash-out wording anywhere (A2.7, S5).

## Legend
- **REUSE**: use the Bubble module as-is. The path and function are given.
- **REUSE+ADAPT**: use the Bubble module, with the stated change. Keep one shared copy, made configurable by an app profile (S7); never fork it.
- **NEW**: Table Craps only, with nothing to reuse in `bb-bc-yrkv`. Where the older App 2 repo (`billy-bubs-practice`, `js/table-engine.js` / `js/table-app.js` / `js/strategies.js`) has prior art, it's named as reference only.
- **Done means:** the acceptance criterion passes in an automated test (unit, or Playwright like the `shot-run*.mjs` harnesses), unless it says "manual".

## Flags resolved or raised while writing this
- **F2, Table Craps badges:** `badges-bubble.md` defines Bubble badges only. **No Table Craps badge list is specced.** The engine is REUSE+ADAPT; the badge definitions need a spec (item BL-03).
- **F3, the Yo bet:** T-18 lists "Yo", but `bb-bc-yrkv` has no Yo kind (the side bets are Any 7 "Big Red", Any Craps, C&E, Horn, hops). Yo is NEW, or it's served by hop 5-6 (item RE-24). It's flagged, not decided.
- **F4, expected loss:** the appendix's Comparison uses per-decision `expectedLoss`. That field exists in the old App 2 engine, but **not** in Bubble's `pushDecision` (`js/engine.mjs:1183-1186`). REUSE+ADAPT: add it from `edgeFor` (item CMP-14).
- **F5, odds settings:** Bubble's `maxPassOdds` / `oddsMultiple` / `maxLayOdds` are hard-coded 3-4-5x / 6x. T-3 / T-4 need 5x and 10x with matching lay (item RE-06).
- **F7 (rev 15a), "cash-out":** Bill asked for color-up "on cash-out". That word is banned (RT-22), so the UI says **"Leave table"** (CR-17).
- **F8 (rev 15a), Big Win vs point-made:** Bubble's BIG WIN lasts 3.5 s with buttons; on a point-made roll the celebration takes over (PM-13). Spec Open question 6.
- **F9 (rev 15a), Rule 0 vs Bubble @ `51c229b`:** the draw passes, but the `Math.random()` fallback and the hostname-only hook gate don't (RD-02, RD-07).
- **F10 (rev 15d), long-press conflict:** the spec already gave long-press on a bet spot two jobs (S1.6 ATS take-down; A2.7.6 "Ana $10 · Ben $5"). Lingo would be a third. Resolved in S4.5 H2: **one spot sheet** (lingo card, Tutor line, Your bet + Take down, On this spot). The rail's "Your chips" sheet and the Comparison chart tooltip keep their own long-press; dock keys get none (LG-06 to LG-08). Spec Open question 9.
- **F11 (rev 16), rail breakdown drift:** the build adds a 4 × $25 reserve (`js/rail.mjs:40-42` @ `34f012d`), so $1,000 → 1 / 3 / 7 / 4 / 5 and `tests/table.test.mjs:172-175` asserts that; CR-02 and A2.2b.2 say 1 / 4 / 3 / 4 / 5. Spec or build must change (not decided).
- **F12 (rev 16), Place 6/8 minimum:** the build hard-codes $12 (`js/table-rules.mjs:214`; `placeSpot`, `js/table-ui.mjs:601-604`) regardless of T-12, so a $5 table can't take the $6 amounts P14-3 allows (RS-09).
- **F13 (rev 16), 6/8 tap increments:** each tap adds ≥ $12, so $18 / $30 can't be built (QB-13).
- **F14 (rev 16), CR-12 fixture:** "Place 6 $10 → +$11.66" is refused by the build's $6-step rule (`stepOf`, `js/table-rules.mjs:172-176`). Use $12 → +$14 or a Buy for the odd-cents case.
- **F15 (rev 16), PM-10 timing:** PM-10 still says Base 1.6 s; spec rev 15c set Base 1.2 / Big 2.0 / Huge 2.5 s. Use the rev 15c values.
- **F16 (rev 16), rules not in the UI:** the engine supports T-2 3:1, every T-3 multiple and per-rules min / max, but `js/table-ui.mjs` exposes none of them, or a starting bankroll (RS-01 to RS-06).
- **F6, ATS in App 2: yes** (S1.6 heading, A2.2, 31 / 31 / 156 FOR 1). **Crapless in App 2: no** (A2.2 "Regular only").
